Let’s analyze the key distribution trends among the travelers.

Travel Type: A significant majority, 68.2%, are Business Travelers, indicating the dominant travel purpose.
Class Distribution: Business and Economy classes are almost equally preferred, with 48.9% and 44.1%, respectively, while Economy Plus is less preferred at just 6.9%.
Satisfaction Levels: Interestingly, 54.6% of passengers report dissatisfaction, highlighting a need for improvement in overall customer experience.

Slide 11:

Now Let’s take a look at satisfaction across age groups:

Passengers aged 18-30 have the highest dissatisfaction, suggesting their expectations may not be met.
On the other hand, Passengers aged 41-50 report the highest satisfaction, indicating strong alignment with their needs.

Slide 22:

We did feature selection and these are the top features that are influencing our model: Online Boarding, Inflight Wifi service, Type of travel, and class of service.

Conclusion slide:

The study identifies multiple factors as central to shaping customer satisfaction in the airline industry, with online boarding emerging as a critical determinant. The demand for a seamless and efficient check-in process has grown substantially among passengers, and online boarding directly addresses this need. By reducing wait times and offering unmatched convenience, this feature establishes a positive tone for the journey and contributes to elevated satisfaction metrics. Airlines that adopt and refine online boarding processes are likely to see significant improvements in customer loyalty and overall ratings.
Another pivotal factor is the availability of in-flight Wi-Fi, which has transitioned from being a supplementary amenity to a core expectation among passengers. For business travelers, uninterrupted connectivity is essential for productivity, while leisure passengers increasingly value the ability to access entertainment and stay connected during flights. Providing consistent and reliable in-flight Wi-Fi not only meets these diverse needs but also enhances the airline’s reputation and competitiveness within the market.
This type of travel influences customer satisfaction in nuanced ways. Business travelers, characterized by higher expectations for comfort and efficiency, represent a key demographic whose satisfaction carries significant weight. Their frequent travel patterns and willingness to pay for premium services underscore the need for tailored amenities. On the other hand, leisure travelers, while more cost-conscious, still appreciate thoughtful enhancements that improve their overall experience.
Additionally, the class of service directly correlates with satisfaction levels. Premium classes, such as Business or First Class, offer passengers enhanced comfort, superior dining, and personalized service, fostering consistently higher satisfaction scores. However, given that most passengers travel in Economy class, even modest improvements in comfort and service in this category can yield a meaningful impact on overall satisfaction ratings.
The analysis further highlights the superior performance of the Random Forest Classifier in identifying the primary drivers of customer satisfaction. Its ability to manage complex datasets and extract feature importance positions it as a valuable tool for data-driven decision-making. This finding underscores the importance of employing advanced analytical techniques to uncover actionable insights that can guide airline strategies.
In conclusion, the study reinforces the importance of adopting a passenger-centric approach to service delivery. Focusing on enhancements in online boarding, in-flight connectivity, class-specific offerings, and differentiated services for varying traveler demographics provides a robust framework for improving satisfaction. Airlines that prioritize these strategies are well-positioned to exceed customer expectations, foster loyalty, and maintain a competitive advantage in a demanding industry.
