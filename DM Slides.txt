Let’s analyze the key distribution trends among the travelers.

Travel Type: A significant majority, 68.2%, are Business Travelers, indicating the dominant travel purpose.
Class Distribution: Business and Economy classes are almost equally preferred, with 48.9% and 44.1%, respectively, while Economy Plus is less preferred at just 6.9%.
Satisfaction Levels: Interestingly, 54.6% of passengers report dissatisfaction, highlighting a need for improvement in overall customer experience.

Slide 11:

Now Let’s take a look at satisfaction across age groups:

Passengers aged 18-30 have the highest dissatisfaction, suggesting their expectations may not be met.
On the other hand, Passengers aged 41-50 report the highest satisfaction, indicating strong alignment with their needs.

Slide 22:

We did feature selection and these are the top features that are influencing our model: Online Boarding, Inflight Wifi service, Type of travel, and class of service.

Conclusion slide:

So we can conclude that these factors play a huge role in driving the model's accuracy. 
First, online boarding stands out because passengers really appreciate a smooth, hassle-free check-in process. 
Then, inflight WiFi is a game-changer—people want to stay connected, especially on longer flights, and that boosts satisfaction. 
When it comes to the type of travel, business travelers are a big focus since they usually expect more comfort and convenience, making their experience a key factor in overall satisfaction. 
Lastly, the class of service speaks for itself—premium classes with better seats, food, and service naturally lead to happier customers.

After analyzing both models, it is clear that the Random Forest Classifier performs better in predicting customer satisfaction.
